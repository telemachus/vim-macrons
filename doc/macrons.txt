INTRODUCTION                                    *macrons*

A set of utility functions and mappings to make it easier to add or remove
macrons.

COMMANDS                                        *macrons-commands*

>
	[range]Demacronize	" Remove macrons from a range of lines
	[range]Macronize	" Add macrons to a range of lines
<

Both functions accept an optional range. If no range is given, they default to
the entire file. This makes it simple to remove the macrons from a whole file
quickly.

CUSTOMIZING                                     *macrons-customizing*

Three maps are available, one for normal mode and two for visual mode. Add
whatever key mappings you prefer to your ~/.vimrc or ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
file. For example,

>
	" In normal mode, flip the macron on a single vowel.
	" That is, if the vowel has a macron, remove it, and if it doesn’t
	" have a macron, add one.
	map <silent> <leader>mf <Plug>CharMacronFlip

	" Place macrons on all the vowels in a visual selection.
	map <silent> <leader>mo <Plug>MacronsOn

	" Remove all the  macrons from a visual selection.
	map <silent> <leader>nm <Plug>MacronsOff
<

All the mappings can be repeated with `.` if you have Tim Pope’s excellent
vim-repeat[1] installed. You should really install that if you don’t have it
already. (Did I mention that it’s excellent?)

INSTALLATION					*macrons-installation*

The easiest way to install is with vim-pathogen[2]. Install that first, and
then simply do the following:

>
	cd ~/.vim/bundle	" or cd ~/.config/nvim/bundle
	git clone https://bitbucket.org/telemachus/vim-macrons
<

ISSUES                                          *macrons-issues*

Only the macrons on vowels are added, removed, or flipped. This is by design,
but maybe that’s a mistake. Let me know if you think so.
